# KingTable 2
Table widget for administrative tables that are able to build themselves, on the basis of their input data.
Supports client and server side pagination; client and server side search; custom filters views; automatic menu to hide columns and support for custom tools. Client side export feature into: csv, json and xml formats.

## Objectives of the library
* Allow the implementation of administrative tables with the [smallest amount of code possible](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/KingTable/wiki/Minimum-effort).
* Allow for easy customization of generated HTML, to adapt to different needs: e.g. displaying pictures thumbnails, anchor tags, etc.
* Support both collections that require server side pagination, and collections that don't require server side pagination, but may still benefit from client side pagination.

## Live demo
The following demos are available online:

## Modes
The KingTable widget implements two working modes:
* fixed (collections that do not require server side pagination)
* normal (collections that require server side pagination)

And supports both optimized and simple collections. Refer to the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/KingTable/wiki/Working-modes) for more information.

### Fixed mode
A fixed table is displaying a collection that doesn't require server side pagination, but may still benefit from client side pagination.
When working on applications, it commonly happens to deal with collections that are not meant to grow over time, and they have a small size.
For example, a table of *categories* in a e-commerce website to sell clothes, or a table of *user roles* in most applications.
In these cases, it makes sense to return whole collections to the clients.
There are two ways to define a fixed KingTable:
* instantiating a KingTable with **url** from where to fetch a collection; then code the server side to return an array of items
* instantiating a KingTable passing a **data** option with an instance of array: in this case, it is assumed that the collection is fixed
```js
var table = new KingTable({
  data: [{...},{...},{...}]
});
//or... code the server side to return an array of items (instead of an object describing a paginated set of results)
var table = new KingTable({
  element:  document.getElementById("my-table"),
  url: "/api/categories"
});
```
Fixed tables perform search and pagination on the client side.

### Normal mode
A normal table is one displaying a collection that requires server side pagination, since it is meant to grow over time.
This is true in most cases, for example tables of *products* and *customers* in a e-commerce website.
```js
var table = new KingTable({
  url: "/api/profiles"
});
```
When receiving an AJAX response, a normal table expects to receive the following structure:
```js
{
  subset: [array],// array of items that respect the given filters
  total: [number] // the total count of items that respect the given filters; excluding the pagination: for example 13000
}
```
## Usability
The KingTable widget is designed to follow "old-school" design principles
* the user should be able to immediately understand the size of the collection, so the pagination bar is designed to display the total amount of rows; of pages, and the number of results currently displayed
* keyboard navigation: the KingTable controls can be navigated using the TAB; it is possible to navigate through pages using the left, right, A and D keys
* support for browser navigation buttons
* the table logic handles ajax errors and displays a preloader while fetching data

### Inline editing feature
The KingTable widget doesn't offer built-in inline editing feature.
This is intentional, since in most situations we deal with complex objects that cannot be easily edited inline.
In any case, the library makes it easy to configure HTML and event handlers to implement inline editing feature,
for example:
```js
//example of custom logic to implement inline-editing feature
var table = new KingTable({
  element:  document.getElementById("my-table"),
  url: "/api/colors",
  events: {
    "click .edit-btn": function (e, item) {
      // e.currentTarget is the clicked element
      // item is the item related to the clicked element
      // implement here your logic to display HTML controls to edit the clicked item (second parameter)
    }
  },
  fields: {
    edit: {
      name: "edit-btn",
      html: function (item) { return "<button class='edit-btn'>Edit</button>"; }
    }
  }
});
```

## About localization
For full information, refer to the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/KingTable/wiki/Implementing-localization).
The KingTable widget includes logic to implement client side localization, which is used to display proper names of buttons (refresh, page number, results per page, etc.).

## Folder description
This folder is meant to contain built JavaScript code (ES5) and other static files, to be used when testing the library with server side web frameworks.
In other words, this folder is used by [development servers](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/KingTable/tree/master/servers) as source of static files.

The contents of this folder are ignored by `git` and are prepared by `gulp` tasks, defined in the [source folder](https://github.com/RobertoPrevato/KingTable/tree/master/source).

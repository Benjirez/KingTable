# Servers
This folder is meant to contain examples of development web servers, to test server side integration with different servers.
Currently, a single implementation using Python Flask web framework is included.

Development servers are meant to serve static files included in above `httpdocs` folder.

Each folder contains a README.md file with instructions on how to run the provided development server.
